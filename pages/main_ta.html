                    family celebrating Tet. You must be wondering whether they are still sharing Tet holiday over there,
                    right? Absolutely! In the West, they can still find banh chung, but not the one wrapped by father's
                    hands. In the West, they can watch Tao Quan too, but watching it at 8 a.m and hurry running off to
                    school. Nevertheless, do not feel moody or think they are alone because there are still friends
                    around them to share and confide in at the year-end parties with all kinds of Vietnamese dishes as
                    well as gather around to reminisce the old Tet's memories and sing along to some classics to welcome

                    Drizzly day accompanied by cold, harsh winds blowing through student's cold hands or making their
                    cheeks blushed. When the year is slowly coming to an end, people tend to reminisce about so many
                    things that happened in a year. Only a few more days till the new year comes, the feeling of longing
                    for something as well as waiting for things to come is a sacred moment that cannot be put into
                    words. Those who are staying in their homeland must be very busy these days. But, for those
                    expatriated students who are currently far away from home, living and working in a totally different
                    country, do they have the same feelings as those who are here?

                </p>
                <img src="../img/content.jpg" alt="" class="main__body__img">

                <p class="main__body__content">
                    Putting aside all of our excited feelings, those who are currently international students must feel
                    the opposite. Being able to fly back to their hometown is a significant thing for students who have
                    the conditions. To be reunited with families and friends, hugging their loved ones has put bright
                    smiles on their faces as well as tears of longing. When we picture those scenarios in our minds, we
                    might imagine a completed family.
                </p>

                <h5 class="main__body__part">The distance between here and home is too far, mom...
                </h5>

                <p class="main__body__content">Contrasting with that scene are the sad and touching emotions of those
                    who do not have financial support to be able to return to reunite with their families, a nostalgia
                    covering them. During this time, homesickness is much more intense. Simply remembering the New
                    Year's smells, the typical smell of Vietnamese New Year holiday, is the scent of Chung cake, the
                    smell of coriander leaves spreading from family to family across the streets and everywhere.
                </p>
                <p class="main__body__content">Tet is an important occasion for the whole family to gather around
                    welcoming a new year to come. The joy of classical spring music, the frost and the grief of an old
                    year aroused a mix of emotions.. From the past until now, Tet has always been a special occasion for
                    families, according to our elders, who often say: “No matter how angry we are with each other, the
                    New Year will erase them all, sip tea, eat a piece of cookie, and then leave behind the old year”.
                </p>

                <p class="main__body__content">What everyone awaits on New Year's day is being reunited with family,
                    sharing a year-end meal together, and experiencing the moment when the old year gives way to the new
                    year. But seemingly simple things like that are just impossible for many young people living and
                    studying abroad. Having to experience the feeling of being thousands of kilometers away from family
                    to appreciate the value of reunion, especially on important occasions like the Lunar New Year.

                    Another year is about to pass and another New Year is coming. Especially for those who are far away
                    from home, returning to their families on the last day of the year to gather together to prepare for
                    the exciting New Year is probably the most anticipated thing that everyone tries to do.

                <p class="main__body__content">
                    But for international students, they do not have such luck. Geographic distance, upcoming semester
                    exams, unfinished works and many other unnamed concerns are always the reasons for their absence
                    from home every Tet holiday.

                    opportunity to interview Ms. Nguyen Thi Thao Phuong - an international student in faraway Germany to
                    ask her about what it is like to live here as well as her feelings when going through many Tet
                    holidays alone, not being able to gather with friends and relatives.

                    years ago and do you still remember how you felt at that time?</p>

                <p class="main__body__content italic">“That day is the 30th day of the Lunar New Year in Vietnam. It's
                    cold here. It's cold in the winter, but the winter sky is gloomy and gloomy. I like the smell of the
                    early morning, the smell of the cool air after each snow melt, especially when there is a light
                    breeze on my face. I feel so high and today's New Year is still a normal day for me. Nothing
                    special. Still the familiar Ludwigsburg station, but every day I arrive on time to the place where I
                    work and then catch the train home.

                <p class="main__body__content italic">
                    I remember the first day that I went to Germany that year when I was 19 and a half years old, seeing
                    everything strange, strange stations, strange train stations, strange faces of westerners. I don't
                    know how to buy train tickets, I don't know how to ask for directions but I've gone to Europe”

                    world outside, right? But, after you've lived in a foreign country for a while, do you remember the
                    times when you celebrated Tet in Vietnam with your family?
                </p>
                <p class="main__body__content italic">“It's very crowded in Vietnam these days, isn't it, guys,when I'm
                    at home, I'm cleaning the house right now. For the past few years, due to the COVID epidemic, I was
                    stuck here and couldn't go home.
                    Suddenly, I remember something like a print on the night of the 30th Tet about 10 years ago. At that
                    time, I was in middle school and after receiving New Year's Eve and accepting lucky money, I
                    finished at my father's company. I remember at that time when I was a tiny child, sitting in the
                    back of the first yellow Lead car, my father went to the house near the house to burn incense and
                    then went to my grandfather's house to wish Tet. That New Year's Eve it was drizzling and I remember
                    my dad told me a sentence like this: “Birds have a human nest with cardboard”. Trees have roots and
                    then give birth, branches give birth, go around telling them that you know this and then go home.
                    And that saying of my father has followed me through all the years I have lived in Europe until
                    now”.

                <p class="main__body__content">- After hearing your uncle's statement, I also feel like I haven't had
                    time to speak with my family in a long time. When I go back to the first time I went to Hanoi to
                    study, I constantly remember my parents' words of caution. I also know that there are many large
                    holidays in Germany at the end of this year; is the environment lively and cheerful, and is it also
                    believed to ease some of the loneliness when living here?

                    through the city center, which is the busiest street here, but it has been cold and deserted for
                    over three months now owing to the outbreak." There is a small corner in the city where but every
                    afternoon I pass by because I have to pass here to go home.

                <p class="main__body__content italic">Normally, if I am unable to return to Vietnam on New Year's Day in
                    order to be in Germany, I will buy flowers to display and clean the house to create a pleasant mood.
                    Alternatively, I could join the student union and meet up with my pals to eat banh chung and banh
                    tet, but all activities are prohibited this year. I'm not allowed to meet more than one person or
                    travel more than 15 kilometers. That's why I didn't do anything today."

                    ago to study overseas, but that all of your plans and calculations broke apart before you even came.
                    You will not be able to study abroad today. But, if we wait another year till the outbreak is ended,
                    there's a chance we'll run into each other in Europe, right? Whatever happens, I wish you all good

                    and Vietnamese people are confident that they are at home, even if they reach out to the vast ocean.
                    Take some time for yourself (especially international students in other countries), lay back, close

                    his parents prepare Tet, through growing up with his family to prepare for the new year, Tet is with
                    each person from childhood to adulthood. When it comes to Tet, each moment has its own thrill that
                    gets us enthusiastic and emotional.

                    Tet represents the days of getting up early with the family to go to the flower market, witnessing
                    the simple joy and happiness on his father's face as he selects a suitable peach branch, and seeing
                    his mother busy preparing the afternoon dinner. Tet. It's also a warm mood when people join together
                    to watch Tao Quan or visit relatives to wish them a happy New Year.

                    and sky, and carrying a camera that is always ready to catch the best moments of the year's first
                    day. So today, distant from home, international students are experiencing the terrible sense of the
                    Tet holiday without family, without lovely items, and with exceedingly simple habits.

                    modern technology, even if they are thousands of miles apart. People, on the other side, are very
                    "greedy" because they still want to purchase one more item that allows us to stay far away while
                    still touching the mother's "ginger" hand, helping her clean the house, and helping her prepare.

                    were at home, have now become a luxury, but it is possible that the New Year away from home has
                    taught them a lot. Every Tet holiday, it teaches them to appreciate the moments of fun with family
                    and loved ones, as well as to cherish the traditional cultural values of their homeland, which
                    motivates them to attempt in other nations.

                    Tet is approaching, and apricot blooms and peach blossoms are flowering in the streets. Every child
                    far from home appears to have a flower budding in his heart, with the hope that this New Year he
                    will be back with his family, in the warm embrace of his parents, and having fun with his family. On
                    a Spring day, friends are observing the streets…

                    When they leave their homeland to lead an independent life themselves in a foreign country, students
                    must prepare for everything, including celebrating Tet holiday away from home. But they will not be
                    alone because there are always new friends around who are always ready to create a wonderful Tet.
                    When Tet comes, Vietnamese students will gather together to cook a meal, tell each other about their
                    stories, and everyone will decorate and cook traditional Vietnamese Tet dishes. Vietnamese
                    international students will still go to school and work as usual, but will choose the day closest to
                    the Lunar New Year to meet and share, which is the most fun and most crowded day of the year.

                    When Tet is near, our friends in Vietnam all shared their preparation moments with their family.
                    Some do the cleaning, some complete their own banh chung,... Overseas students might be a little bit
                    heartbroken when they are away from home on such an occasion. So to ease the homesick feeling, the
                    Korean student’s community decides to celebrate the event together. They visit Vietnamese’s market
                    to collect the necessary ingredients to create a table full of Vietnamese traditional cuisine. They
                    will eat, have a good time together and wait until the year’s transition. For the fellow students
                    who are far from home, they are treated as family members.

                <p class="main__body__content">
                    Traditional dishes such as silk rolls, spring rolls, and banh chung are still served though the
                    taste can not be as delicious as back home since the ingredients in Korea are difficult to find as
                    well as expensive. Nevertheless, everyone is delighted as they have friends to soften the
                    homesickness and confide with each other.

                <p class="main__body__content">
                    Meanwhile, they also spend time cleaning up their rooms, decorating with small items and calling
                    home on New Year's Eve to celebrate the new year with their families. Looking at the members
                    laughing and joking through the phone screen, sending New Year wishes to the other half of the
                    hemisphere is always a moment that makes young people touched, remember forever. Distance at that
                    time also gradually became meaningless.

                <p class="main__body__content">For overseas students, this year is likely to be a Tet celebration away
                    from home. Although sad and lonely, there is still hope that individuals far away will share the
                    problems of life and work together to create a warm New Year in a faraway nation to work for a
                    greater goal than mastering knowledge and become those who take the opportunity to shine and
                    succeed...

                <p class="main__body__content">Due to Covid-19, this year is definitely a special year to celebrate Tet
                    away from home for international students who have confided and shared their hearts with reporters.
                    Overcoming all sadness and loneliness, hope that people who are far from home will share the
                    difficulties in life, together create a warm Tet in a foreign land to work towards a bigger goal
                    than understanding knowledge and become those who seize the opportunity to shine and succeed… Tet is
                    coming in slowly with the hope that the epidemic will be controlled so that life will return to
                    normal soon.

                <p class="main__body__content">Tet of Vietnamese students is gently passing along with congratulating,
                    comforting and patting each other. Despite the absence of family, Vietnamese international students
                    always motivate themselves to get over and reach a better new year of study and a happier life.
                    Putting all these fleeting emotions aside, they continue to deal with all the other issues of making
                    their way for life.
